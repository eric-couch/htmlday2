      I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various
      species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a
      kilometer. Humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third
      of the way down the list....That didn't look so good, but then someone at
      Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion
      for a man on a bicycle and a man on a bicycle blew the condor away. That's
      what a computer is to me: the computer is the most remarkable tool that
      we've ever come up with. It's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.
